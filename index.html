    <h3>Who I Am:</h3>
    <p>
        I am a software engineer and full stack web 
        developer based in Columbia, South Carolina.

        with a Bachelor's in Media and Communications
        and Minors in Music Technology and Philosophy,
        I have gone on to earn certifications in HTML5
        and Javascript for Web Development from Holyoke
